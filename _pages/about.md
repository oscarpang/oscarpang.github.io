Hi visitor!

My name is Weiwu Pang. I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science department at the University of Southern California. I'm currenly a member of Networked System Lab and advised by Prof. Ramesh Govindan. 

I have a broad interest in different topics in networking system. 

The major theme that I'm working toward my PhD thesis is about using computing resources at the edge to accomplish tasks including autonomous driving and AR/VR applications.

Besides that, I'm also interested in topics in the areas of networking and large-scale computing system.

Here are the list of publications of the projects that I've been working since my PhD career.

Before joining NSL, I participated in several exciting research projects during my undergraduate study. This experience drove me in making the decision to go to grad school. Here are the publications of the projects during that period.
